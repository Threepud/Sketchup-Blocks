Sketchup Blocks
===============

Developer Blog: http://sketchupblocks.wordpress.com/

The project subscribes to the concept of the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things is centred around the idea of ‘smart objects’ which are physical objects and devices that are given a virtual representation and linked to information networks. These smart objects will ideally be able to capture, react to and communicate about data captured from their physical environment autonomously.

This project aims to create a system that can convert physical 3D models into digital models that can be viewed and edited in Google Sketchup. The physical model will be built with blocks that have fiducial markers attached. The locations of these blocks will be picked up on web cameras by Reactivision software and the resulting data will be used to create digital 3D models that can be viewed and exported to Google Sketchup.
